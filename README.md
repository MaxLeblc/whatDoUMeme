This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Info

This frontend project is a MEME generator!!!

The application uses an API to retrieve a list of known MEMEs.

You can edit your choice of MEMEs with text to generate a customized MEME and download it.

This project was an opportunity for me to start learning TypeScript.
